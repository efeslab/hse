* Object.finalize() is a deprecated API. In order to better support Java,
	we probably need to look into either using Closeable/AutoCloseable for our
	classes or forget Java 1.8 and go straight to 1.9+ and look into using the
	Cleaner/Cleanable constructs...

	NOTE: leaning toward the Closeable/AutoCloseable APIs; Transaction already
	supports AutoCloseable, just needs it finalize() method removed.
